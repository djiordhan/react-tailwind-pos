# react-tailwind-pos

![react-tailwind-pos](https://github.com/djiordhan/react-tailwind-pos/blob/main/demo/demo-pos.png)

This is a React port of the popular Tailwind POS application by emsifa (https://github.com/emsifa/tailwind-pos). The original uses plain HTML, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS for a lightweight and efficient POS system. This project translates that functionality into React components, offering a more structured and scalable approach.

Features

* Product listing and search
* Cart management with quantity updates
* Basic checkout flow (implementation may vary)
* Built with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
